## üéØ Problem Statement 
Pizza restaurants generate huge amounts of transactional data every day, but without proper analysis, valuable insights into customer preferences, product performance, and sales trends remain hidden. Management often struggles with questions like:

- Which pizzas should be promoted more aggressively?
- Are certain menu items underperforming and costing more to keep than they bring in?
- How do sales patterns change across days, months, or hours, and how can staffing or marketing be optimized around these trends?
- Does the price of a pizza influence how often it gets ordered?

This project addresses these challenges by analyzing pizza sales data to uncover trends in product performance, customer demand, and time-based sales patterns. By answering these questions, the analysis provides a data-driven foundation for:

1. Menu optimization ‚Üí identifying best-sellers and low performers
2. Marketing strategies ‚Üí targeting promotions based on popular pizzas and peak times
3. Operational efficiency ‚Üí planning staff schedules around busy periods

The ultimate goal is to transform raw sales data into actionable insights that support smarter business decisions, increase revenue, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Key Findings
## üí° Business Insights  

1. **Promote Best-Selling Pizzas**  
   - Pizzas like *Thai Chicken*, *Barbecue Chicken*, and *Classic Deluxe* consistently drive high sales and revenue.  
   - These pizzas should be prioritized in **marketing campaigns, meal bundles, and loyalty programs** to maximize profitability.  

2. **Reevaluate Low-Performing Pizzas**  
   - Pizzas such as *Brie Carre* and *Spinach Supreme* generate minimal sales.  
   - They may be considered for **menu removal** or targeted **niche promotions** to reduce costs and simplify inventory.  

3. **Optimize Inventory Management**  
   - The **Classic pizza category** contributes the most to revenue, meaning ingredients like cheese, pepperoni, and tomato sauce should be prioritized in supply chain planning.  
   - **Veggie pizzas** sell the least, indicating a risk of ingredient overstock and waste.  

4. **Align Product Strategy with Size Preferences**  
   - **Large pizzas** are the most popular, while **XXL pizzas** perform poorly.  
   - Phasing out XXL sizes (or running limited-time XXL promotions) could help optimize resources and menu design.  

5. **Adjust Pricing Strategy**  
   - The **negative correlation (-0.31)** between price and popularity suggests that higher prices reduce sales volumes.  
   - **Revisiting pricing tiers**‚Äîespecially for mid-range pizzas‚Äîcould encourage more frequent purchases and boost total revenue.  

6. **Leverage Time-Based Trends**  
   - **Fridays** and **lunchtime (12 PM)** are peak sales periods.  
   - Businesses should:  
     - Schedule **additional staff** during these times to meet demand.  
     - Run **lunchtime specials** or **Friday promotions** to capitalize on customer behavior.  

7. **Plan for Seasonal Demand**  
   - **July** recorded the highest orders, while **October** had the lowest.  
   - Restaurants can balance demand with **seasonal campaigns** (e.g., summer family deals, fall-themed promotions).  


## üöÄ Next Steps / Future Improvements
